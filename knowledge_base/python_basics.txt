Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Key features of Python:
- Easy to learn and use
- Free and open-source
- High-level language
- Interpreted language
- Dynamically typed
- Object-oriented language
- Extensible
- Large standard library
- Supports GUI programming

Variables in Python are used to store data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Example:
x = 10
name = "Alice"

Data types in Python:
- Numeric: int, float, complex
- Sequence: list, tuple, range
- Text: str
- Mapping: dict
- Set: set, frozenset
- Boolean: bool
- Binary: bytes, bytearray, memoryview

Functions are blocks of organized, reusable code that perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

Example of a function:
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

Control flow statements:
- if/elif/else: Conditional execution
- for loop: Iterating over a sequence
- while loop: Repeating as long as a condition is true
