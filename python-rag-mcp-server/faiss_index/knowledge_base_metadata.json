["Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Key features of Python:\n- Easy to learn and use\n- Free and open-source\n- High-level language\n- Interpreted language\n- Dynamically typed\n- Object-oriented language\n- Extensible\n- Large standard library\n- Supports GUI programming\n\nVariables in Python are used to store data values.", "Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Example:\nx = 10\nname = \"Alice\"\n\nData types in Python:\n- Numeric: int, float, complex\n- Sequence: list, tuple, range\n- Text: str\n- Mapping: dict\n- Set: set, frozenset\n- Boolean: bool\n- Binary: bytes, bytearray, memoryview\n\nFunctions are blocks of organized, reusable code that perform a single, related action.", "Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.", "Example of a function:\ndef greet(name):\n    return \"Hello, \" + name\n\nControl flow statements:\n- if/elif/else: Conditional execution\n- for loop: Iterating over a sequence\n- while loop: Repeating as long as a condition is true\n\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).", "Key concepts of OOP include:\n1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (e.g., a class). 2. Inheritance: A mechanism where a new class (subclass) is derived from an existing class (superclass). The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass. 3. Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. 4.", "Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary and relevant information to the user. Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, databases use B-tree indexes for fast data retrieval.", "Common data structures include:\n- Arrays: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. - Linked Lists: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next. - Stacks: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure. - Queues: A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. - Trees: Hierarchical data structures. - Graphs: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges."]
