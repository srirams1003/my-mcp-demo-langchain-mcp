# LangChain MCP Agent Demo

This project demonstrates a couple of multi-tool agents built with LangChain.js, LangGraph.js, and the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP). The agents in these files can interact with multiple independent MCP servers that provide tools for different functionalities.

## Directory Structure

This repository is organized into the following subdirectories:

*   `javascript-mcp-and-agents/`: Contains Node.js scripts for MCP servers and agents.
*   `langsmith-studio-integration/`: Contains a LangGraph.js agent integrated with Langsmith Studio.
*   `python-mcp-clients-and-agents/`: Contains Python scripts for MCP clients and agents.
*   `python-rag-mcp-server/`: Contains a Python-based MCP server for a RAG pipeline.
*   `python-system-info-mcp-server/`: Contains a Python-based MCP server for system information.
*   `python_rag_practice/`: Contains Python scripts for practicing with RAG.
*   `typescript-weather-mcp-server/`: Contains a TypeScript-based MCP server for weather information.

## Setup
